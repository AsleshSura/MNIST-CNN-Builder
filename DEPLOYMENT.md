# ðŸš€ Deployment Guide

## Production Build

The project has been built and is ready for deployment. Here are the deployment options:

### GitHub Pages (Recommended)
The project is already configured for GitHub Pages deployment:

```bash
cd cnn-builder
npm run deploy
```

This will build the project and deploy it to GitHub Pages automatically.

### Manual Deployment
If you prefer to deploy manually:

1. **Build the project**:
   ```bash
   cd cnn-builder
   npm run build
   ```

2. **Deploy the `build` folder** to your hosting service:
   - Copy contents of `cnn-builder/build/` to your web server
   - Serve the files using any static file server

### Local Testing
To test the production build locally:

```bash
cd cnn-builder
npm install -g serve
serve -s build
```

## Environment Requirements

### Production Server
- **Static File Server**: Any server capable of serving HTML/JS/CSS
- **HTTPS**: Recommended for TensorFlow.js features
- **Memory**: TensorFlow.js requires adequate browser memory

### Browser Requirements
- **Modern Browsers**: Chrome 90+, Firefox 88+, Safari 14+, Edge 90+
- **WebGL Support**: Required for GPU acceleration
- **JavaScript**: Must be enabled
- **Local Storage**: For model export/import features

## Performance Considerations

### Optimization Applied
- **Code Splitting**: Automatic via Create React App
- **Minification**: All assets minified in production build
- **Memory Management**: Proper tensor disposal implemented
- **Lazy Loading**: Components loaded as needed

### Monitoring
- Monitor browser console for any TensorFlow.js warnings
- Check memory usage during training for large models
- Verify MNIST dataset downloads correctly on first use

## Security

- **Client-Side Only**: No server-side components or data storage
- **Local Processing**: All computation happens in the browser
- **No External APIs**: Self-contained application
- **CORS Ready**: Can be served from any domain

## Support

The application is designed to be self-contained and user-friendly. Key features:

- **Self-Validating**: Architecture validation prevents invalid configurations
- **Error Handling**: Graceful error messages and recovery
- **Memory Management**: Automatic cleanup to prevent memory leaks
- **Cross-Browser**: Tested on major browsers
