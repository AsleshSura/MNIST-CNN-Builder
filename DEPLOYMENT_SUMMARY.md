The MNIST CNN Builder repository has been successfully prepared for deployment with the following improvements:

### 🧹 Files Removed (Development/Testing)
- ❌ `TESTING_GUIDE.md` - Internal testing documentation
- ❌ `ENHANCED_IMPORT_EXPORT_FEATURES.md` - Development feature notes
- ❌ `PROJECT_FIXES_APPLIED.md` - Development fix tracking
- ❌ `cleanup_script.ps1` - Development cleanup script
- ❌ `cnn-builder/README.md` - Duplicate development README
- ❌ `docs/feature-map-visualizer/README.md` - Duplicate documentation

### 📝 Files Updated for Production
- ✅ `README.md` - Cleaned up development sections, focused on user experience
- ✅ Enhanced import/export functionality with weights support
- ✅ All TypeScript compilation errors resolved
- ✅ Production build successfully generated

### 🆕 Files Added
- ✅ `DEPLOYMENT.md` - Comprehensive deployment guide

  - With Weights (trained model parameters)  
  - Complete (weights + training history + performance metrics)

## 🎯 Key Enhancements Delivered

### Advanced Export/Import System
1. **Three Export Levels**:
   - **Architecture Only**: Layer configuration and training settings
   - **With Weights**: Complete trained model with all parameters
   - **Complete**: Full package including training history and metrics

2. **Enhanced Metadata**:
   - Detailed model descriptions and versioning
   - Author attribution and tagging system
   - Export type tracking for compatibility

3. **Smart Validation**:
   - Import file validation with detailed error messages
   - Architecture compatibility checking
   - Comprehensive import summaries

4. **User Experience**:
   - Interactive export type selection
   - Real-time preview of export contents
   - Advanced options panel for power users
   - Clear visual feedback throughout the process

### Technical Improvements
- **Weight Extraction**: Layer-by-layer weight capture using TensorFlow.js APIs
- **Training History**: Complete epoch-by-epoch metrics preservation
- **Performance Analytics**: Parameter counting and model complexity analysis
- **Memory Management**: Proper tensor disposal and resource cleanup
